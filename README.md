# Mortgage-Lending-Decision


## Research question:
Controlling for relevant characteristics, is race/ethnicity associated with the outcome of a mortgage loan application?

## Data:
In 1990, following the request of the Federal Reserve Board of Boston, lending institutions in the Boston area provided additional information relevant to mortgage lending decisions.  In light of the relatively small number of mortgage loan applications made by minorities, these extra variables were collected for all applications by blacks and Hispanics and for a random sample of those by whites.
